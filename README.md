## Informations

For each edition I create a new folder with name `YYYY`, where YYYY is a specific year.

For each puzzle, there is a directory `YYYY/Day DD`, where DD is number of the day.

Each puzzle has two levels, inside the folder, there are two files with my solutions, `part-one.js` and `part-two.js` and `test.js` wich testing my solution with example data and prints the results for the production input if test is passed.

In each puzzle I import data from `data.txt` wich includes input data downloaded from `https://adventofcode.com/YYYY/day/D/input` and `test.data.txt` wich are in the content of the task for every day `https://adventofcode.com/YYYY/day/D`
