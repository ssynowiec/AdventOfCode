# üéÑ Advent of Code üéÅ

> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## Informations

For each edition I create a new folder with name `YYYY`, where YYYY is a specific year.

For each puzzle, there is a directory `YYYY/Day DD`, where DD is number of the day.

<!-- Each puzzle has two levels, inside the folder, there are two files with my solutions, `part-one.js` and `part-two.js` and `test.js` wich testing my solution with example data and prints the results for the production input if test is passed. -->

<!-- In each puzzle I import data from `data.txt` wich includes input data downloaded from `https://adventofcode.com/YYYY/day/D/input` and `test.data.txt` wich are in the content of the task for every day `https://adventofcode.com/YYYY/day/D` -->
